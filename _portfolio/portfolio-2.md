Compact objects like white dwarfs and neutron stars are part of the entities that populate the universe and play a role in astrophysical and cosmological observations. These objects belong to the family of compact fermionic objects that conform to the universe.

Parallel to these objects are **boson stars**, hypothetical compact objects made of spin $\(s = 0\)$ bosons, and **Proca stars**, compact objects made of spin $\(s = 1\)$ bosons. These hypothetical objects could account for dark matter: massive self-gravitating scalar (or vector) fields can form stable astrophysical (or subatomic) objects supported by self-gravity and Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle.

Although the cold dark matter model (CDM) within the standard cosmological model $\(\Lambda\)$ CDM explains large-scale structure so well, it faces issues on galactic scales:  

- CDM simulations predict cuspy density profiles at galactic centers, whereas rotation curves suggest smooth cores.  
- The predicted number of satellite galaxies around galactic halos is higher than observed.  

If dark matter is composed of boson particles in a Bose-Einstein condensate (as in boson stars), these problems might be mitigated. Boson and Proca star phenomenology could address the cusp and missing satellite problems.
