**Chinook Data Analysis Project**

This project presents an exploratory and analytical study of the Chinook sample database, a relational database that represents a digital music store. The main objective is to demonstrate a complete data analysis workflow, from structured SQL queries to higher-level insights obtained through Python-based analysis.

Using SQLite as the backend, the project focuses on extracting, transforming, and analyzing data related to customers, invoices, tracks, artists, and sales patterns. The analysis emphasizes practical questions such as revenue distribution, customer behavior, and genre popularity, showcasing how relational databases can be effectively combined with data science tools.

The full analysis, including queries, visualizations, and interpretations, is documented in a Jupyter Notebook available via NBViewer:

This project is intended as a concise demonstration of applied data analysis skills, integrating SQL, Python, and exploratory data analysis in a reproducible and transparent manner.
